Future Scope :-

Cloud Storage for User Programs:
In the future, we plan to allow users to save their programs as files in the cloud. This will enable users to:

1. Save their programs and access them later from any device
2. Organize their programs into folders and projects
3. Share their programs with others by sharing a link to the file
4. Collaborate with others on projects in real-time
5. To achieve this, we will integrate a cloud storage service such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or Amazon S3. Users will be able to save their programs to their cloud storage account and access them later by logging in to their account.

Additional Features :-
We also plan to add the following features in the future:

1. Version control: allow users to track changes to their programs and revert to previous versions if needed
2. Real-time collaboration: allow multiple users to collaborate on a program in real-time
3. Code completion: provide code completion suggestions to users as they type
4. Code analysis: provide code analysis and debugging tools to help users identify errors and improve their code
5. Give users daily quizes and competetive questions to solve and rank  them according to theirÂ efficiency
